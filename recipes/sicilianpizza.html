                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 4 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of active dry yeast, and 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
                        <li> Slowly add 1 1/2 cups of warm water and 1/4 cup of olive oil to the dry ingredients, mixing until the dough forms a ball. </li>
                        <li> Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, until it's smooth and elastic. </li>
                        <li> Place the dough in a large, oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size. </li>
                        <li> Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and grease a large, rectangular baking dish or pizza pan with olive oil. </li>
                        <li> Punch down the risen dough and press it into the pan, making sure it's spread evenly. </li>
                        <li> Spread 2 cups of tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                        <li> Sprinkle 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese over the tomato sauce, making sure it's spread evenly.</li>
                        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. </li>
                        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. </li>
