    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="recipe-des">
            Paneer Butter Masala is a rich and creamy vegetarian dish that originates from Northern India. It consists of cubes of soft and creamy paneer (a type of Indian cheese) cooked in a tomato-based sauce made with a blend of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala, as well as butter and cream. The dish has a mild heat level and a deliciously smooth and velvety texture that melts in your mouth. Legend has it that the dish was accidentally invented in the 1950s by a chef who ran out of ingredients to make a classic chicken dish, and so substituted paneer instead. Today, it is one of the most popular vegetarian dishes in India and is enjoyed around the world for its rich and complex flavors.
