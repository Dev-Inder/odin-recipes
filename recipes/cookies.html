            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class="recipe-des">Chocolate chip cookies are a timeless classic that will take your taste buds on a nostalgic journey with every bite. The buttery and chewy texture, coupled with the richness of the chocolate chips, make for a heavenly experience that is simply irresistible. Created by Ruth Wakefield in 1938, the chocolate chip cookie has been an American staple ever since. Originally, Wakefield was trying to make a chocolate cookie, but when she ran out of baker's chocolate, she substituted it with broken pieces of Nestle chocolate. The result was the first batch of chocolate chip cookies, which have since become a beloved treat enjoyed by people of all ages around the world.</p>

                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then add in the vanilla extract and mix until combined.</li>

                <li>Using a cookie scoop or spoon, drop the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave about 2 inches between each cookie.</li>

                <li>Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
